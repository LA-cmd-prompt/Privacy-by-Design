# Privacy-by-Design

# Why is PbD important
PbD is now a legal requirement in many jurisdictions (including under GDPR and anticipated Canadian reforms like Bill C-27), making it a foundational compliance skill.

# Privacy by Design (PbD) Project

This folder contains a practical guide and example demonstrating how **Privacy by Design** principles can be embedded into business processes and technology.

---

## Overview
Privacy by Design (PbD) is about embedding privacy into systems and workflows **from the start**—not as an afterthought. This project shows how I would approach applying PbD in a compliance or operational context.

---

## What’s Inside
- **privacy-by-design-guide.md** → An overview of the 7 principles of PbD with practical applications in Canadian compliance (e.g., PIPEDA) and global contexts (e.g., GDPR).
- **sample-use-case.pdf** *(optional)* → A fictional scenario (e.g., implementing new HR software) showing how PbD could be applied in practice.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Translating privacy principles into **operational strategies**  
- Applying PbD to **Canadian compliance frameworks (PIPEDA, CASL)**  
- Designing processes that integrate privacy risk management into day-to-day operations  

---

## Next Steps
This PbD example ties into my **DPIA** and **PIA** projects, which show how to operationalize privacy through structured risk assessments.
